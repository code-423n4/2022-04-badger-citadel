Just to be clear is the scope just : ibBTC Zap.sol,  VaultZap.sol,  DepositZapibBTC.vy (not CurveZap.vy),  SettToRenIbbtcZap.sol.

nice to see Foundry being used! FYI the `testSetTokenInLimit()` test is failing because of a wrong order. function call should be done after event emission.

```
uint256 newTokenInLimit = 100 * 10**tokenIn.decimals();
      
vm.expectEmit(false, false, false, true);
emit TokenInLimitUpdated(newTokenInLimit);
tokenSale.setTokenInLimit(newTokenInLimit);

assertEq(newTokenInLimit, tokenSale.tokenInLimit());
```

Is VipGuestListUpgradeable.sol under utils folder in scope?


[02/04/2022 1:45 PM] madarfadar
Nice catch. Weird that the test passes on our ci

@tabish.eth could you define the scope ? it's only `TokenSaleUpgradeable.sol`?


[02/04/2022 6:48 PM] tabish.eth
Yes the scope is only TokenSaleUpgradeable.sol

@tabish.eth Could you give some info on what type of proxy you're expecting `TokenSaleUpgradeable.sol` to be behind?


[02/05/2022 1:14 AM] Tom | Aztec#3331
I'm expecting this sale to be a one off, correct?


[02/05/2022 7:50 AM] tabish.eth
yes it would be a one off sale, we are expecting to put it behind `TransparentUpgradeableProxy`

{Reactions}
thankyou 

[02/05/2022 9:38 PM] ospwner#2746
@tabish.eth what is the planned use case of "daoCommitments" and dao ids. I mean are you going to use them in a web UI or other contracts, what kind of commitments they represent? I couldn't infere much because the contract only stores ids and amounts.


[02/06/2022 8:06 AM] tabish.eth
In the web ui a user would be given an option to select a dao when buying into the token sale. so daoCommitments would represent total number of votes (ie. total CTDL token brought by users and give vote to a dao). based on that a % of CTDL token would be given to the DAO

thankyou

The MedianOracle.sol on the github is empty, but presumed it's just copy/pasted from ampleforth's?  (https://github.com/ampleforth/market-oracle/blob/master/contracts/MedianOracle.sol - link from the c4a page)?

when you say all contracts, does that mean all of these too? https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-badger-citadel/tree/main/lib


[04/14/2022 10:23 AM] p_crypt0
Also, the "BaseFixture.sol" link on c4a takes me back to c4a homescreen - link needs changing to reflect github repo?

[04/14/2022 11:00 AM] dapp_whisperer
Yes, it can be assumed to be the median oracle from that repo. It has to live in its own repo due to complier version / dependency management in Foundry

❤️ 

[04/14/2022 11:00 AM] dapp_whisperer
That file shouldn’t be in the repo, that was an oversight on my part


[04/14/2022 11:01 AM] dapp_whisperer
No, those are dependency files. The ones used in the project can be considered in terms of their usage in the project files in /src


[04/14/2022 11:01 AM] dapp_whisperer
I’ll clarify on readme


[04/14/2022 11:02 AM] dapp_whisperer
I’ll take a look, thanks. The BaseFixture.sol can be found in /src/tests/

[04/14/2022 11:42 AM] p_crypt0
Thank you! If it's any help, the others on the c4a page are also redirecting to homepage. Think the hyperlink setting is just appending the path to the "'https:code4rena.com'"  as opposed to the github repo


[04/14/2022 4:26 PM] liveactionllamac4
Those links should be directing correctly now. 🙂

will the issues from the prior badger citadel contest be made available before the end of this contest? KnightingRound.sol seems to be similar to the sole contract of that contest

@dapp_whisperer can i dm?

Did I earn even 1 usdc from this? I'm excited, but also so afraid to see the awarding results🥲

According to the Monday Roll Up it's still in the sponsor review phase.

what's the status on this one?


[06/08/2022 6:36 PM] liveactionllamac4
Hi! It looks like judging could be finishing up soon and then it'll go back to the sponsor for a QA review. If there's not much for the judge and sponsor to discuss, I think this could potentially move to awarding sometime next week. 🤞
